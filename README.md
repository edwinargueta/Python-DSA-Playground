# Python DSA Playground

A working repository for implementing classic data structures and algorithms from
scratch in **Python 3** — no library shortcuts, no copied solutions.

---

## Why this repo exists

I'm a Senior Lead Software Engineer. Day to day, that role is mostly architecture,
technical direction, code review, and mentorship — the leverage comes from judgment
rather than from writing tree traversals by hand. But the fundamentals are exactly
what that judgment is built on, and they atrophy quietly if you never exercise them.

This repo is deliberate practice against that decay:

- **Better technical judgment.** Choosing between a hash map, a balanced tree, and a
  heap is a design decision with real cost implications. Reasoning fluently about
  complexity, memory layout, and access patterns is what separates a defensible
  architecture from one that merely works today.
- **Sharper code review.** Recognizing an accidental O(n²) or a subtle off-by-one in
  someone else's pull request requires having written — and debugged — those patterns
  yourself.
- **Credible mentorship.** Engineers I support hit these problems in interviews and in
  production. Explaining *why* a red-black tree rebalances the way it does is far more
  useful than pointing at documentation.
- **Staying interview-ready.** Senior roles still assess fundamentals. Keeping this warm
  year-round beats cramming under pressure.

Continual growth at this level isn't about learning the newest framework. It's about
keeping the foundations sharp enough that the higher-order decisions come easily.

## Ground rules

The constraints are the point — they're what make this practice rather than review:

1. **Implement from first principles.** No `heapq`, no `collections.deque`, no
   `bisect` for the structure being built. The standard library is the thing being
   reimplemented, not the tool used to reimplement it.
2. **Type hints throughout.** Every public method carries annotations. Signatures
   should be self-documenting.
3. **Document the complexity.** Each operation states its time and space cost, and
   the reasoning behind it.
4. **Handle the edges deliberately.** Empty structures, single elements, duplicates,
   removing the root. The edge cases are where the real understanding lives.
5. **Test the behavior, not the implementation.** Tests should survive a rewrite of
   the internals.

## Engineering Workflow & AI Acceleration

To maximize implementation speed while maintaining strict code quality:
* **Core Architecture & Logic:** Designed and implemented manually from first principles.
* **Test Case Generation:** Standard assertions and edge-case suites (e.g., boundary conditions, random tree insertion sequences) were generated using Claude and verified against manual invariants.

## Repository structure

Each top-level folder is one self-contained data structure or algorithm family, with
its implementation, its tests, and its own notes. Folders are independent — there are
no cross-imports and no shared framework, so any one can be read in isolation.

## Running the code

Requires Python 3.10 or newer — developed against 3.13. No third-party dependencies.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:edwinargueta/Python-DSA-Playground.git
cd Python-DSA-Playground/BinarySearchTree
python3 binary_search_tree.py
```

Each module includes a `__main__` block demonstrating its structure in use.

## Big-O complexity reference

Quick reference for the structures and algorithms covered in this repo.
`n` = number of elements, `V` = vertices, `E` = edges, `k` = value range,
`d` = number of digits, `m` = key length.

### Data structures

Average case, with worst case noted where it differs materially:

| Structure | Access | Search | Insert | Delete | Space |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Array (static) | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Dynamic array (`list`) | O(1) | O(n) | O(1)* / O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Singly linked list | O(n) | O(n) | O(1)† | O(1)† | O(n) |
| Doubly linked list | O(n) | O(n) | O(1)† | O(1)† | O(n) |
| Stack | O(n) | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) |
| Queue | O(n) | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) |
| Hash table | — | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) |
| Binary search tree | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Balanced BST (AVL, red-black) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Binary heap | O(1)‡ | O(n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Trie | — | O(m) | O(m) | O(m) | O(n·m) |

\* Amortized for append; O(n) for arbitrary-position insert or a resize.
† At the head, or at a node you already hold a reference to; O(n) if you must find it first.
‡ Peek at min/max only — arbitrary access is O(n).

**Worst cases that matter:**

| Structure | Degrades to | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Hash table | O(n) per operation | Every key colliding into one bucket |
| Binary search tree | O(n) per operation | Sorted or near-sorted insertion order |
| Balanced BST | O(log n) — no degradation | Rebalancing is the guarantee |

### Sorting algorithms

| Algorithm | Best | Average | Worst | Space | Stable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bubble sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | Yes |
| Insertion sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | Yes |
| Selection sort | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | No |
| Merge sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n) | Yes |
| Quicksort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n²) | O(log n) | No |
| Heapsort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(1) | No |
| Counting sort | O(n + k) | O(n + k) | O(n + k) | O(k) | Yes |
| Radix sort | O(d(n + k)) | O(d(n + k)) | O(d(n + k)) | O(n + k) | Yes |
| Timsort (`sorted`) | O(n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n) | Yes |

*Stable* means equal elements keep their original relative order — which matters
whenever you sort by one key after already sorting by another.

### Graph algorithms

| Algorithm | Time | Space | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| BFS | O(V + E) | O(V) | Shortest path on unweighted graphs |
| DFS | O(V + E) | O(V) | Cycle detection, connected components |
| Topological sort | O(V + E) | O(V) | DAGs only |
| Dijkstra (binary heap) | O((V + E) log V) | O(V) | No negative edge weights |
| Bellman-Ford | O(V·E) | O(V) | Handles negative edges; detects negative cycles |
| Floyd-Warshall | O(V³) | O(V²) | All-pairs shortest paths |
| Union-Find | O(α(n)) amortized | O(V) | With path compression and union by rank |

α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function — under 5 for any input size that fits in
memory, so effectively constant.

### Graph representations

| Representation | Space | Edge lookup | Iterate neighbors |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adjacency list | O(V + E) | O(degree) | O(degree) |
| Adjacency matrix | O(V²) | O(1) | O(V) |

Adjacency lists win for sparse graphs, which is most real-world graphs. Matrices are
worth it only when the graph is dense or you need constant-time edge queries.

### Python-specific costs

Worth internalizing, since these are where idiomatic-looking Python quietly goes
quadratic:

| Operation | Complexity | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `x in list` | O(n) | Linear scan |
| `x in set` / `x in dict` | O(1) | Hash lookup — the usual fix for the above |
| `list.append(x)` | O(1) amortized | Occasional O(n) resize |
| `list.insert(0, x)` | O(n) | Shifts every element |
| `list.pop()` | O(1) | From the end |
| `list.pop(0)` | O(n) | Shifts every element |
| `str += s` in a loop | O(n²) | Strings are immutable — use `"".join()` |
| `sorted(iterable)` | O(n log n) | Timsort; near-linear on partially sorted input |

The classic bug is an `x in list` check inside a loop over the same list — it reads as
O(n) and runs as O(n²). Swapping the list for a set is usually the whole fix.

## Choosing the right structure

Complexity tables answer *how fast*; this answers *which one*:

| Requirement | Structure | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Key/value lookup by exact key | Hash table | O(1) average |
| Sorted order maintained | Balanced BST | O(log n) ops, in-order traversal is sorted |
| Always need the min or max | Heap | O(1) peek, O(log n) extract |
| LIFO | Stack | Natural fit |
| FIFO | Queue | Natural fit |
| Prefix / autocomplete search | Trie | O(m) in key length, not collection size |
| Frequent insert/delete at ends | Doubly linked list | O(1) at both ends |
| Index-based access | Dynamic array | O(1) random access |

The gap between a BST's average and worst case is the entire argument for
self-balancing trees — an unbalanced BST fed sorted input degrades into a linked list,
and O(log n) silently becomes O(n).
